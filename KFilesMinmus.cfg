I know, it's difficult to believe, when they look so much like weather balloons. I am actually working on a shadow operation, known as "Project Nightingale". This operations primary mission, is to find evidence of life beyond Kerbin, and assess whether it is a threat to Kerbalkind. That thing you found in the ice? We think it's an alien spaceship, and it's transmitting a signal. The one you found on Mun is too. We've managed to triangulate the source to a spot on Minmus. I want you to take Scully and I to investigate.

It seems this race of aliens are between 5.5 and 6 feet tall, have much longer arms and legs than we do, and have some kind of protrusion sticking out from the middle of their face, which helps them to breath. I suspect they had something to do with the recent atmospheric changes we've experienced. I'll need more time before I can tell you more.
